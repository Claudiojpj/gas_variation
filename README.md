# Gasoline Price Variation Prediction with Python and Apache Airflow

Welcome to the Gasoline Price Variation Prediction project! In this project, we use Python for web scraping to track gasoline prices and relevant factors, then employ predictive analytics to forecast gasoline price fluctuations. To make the process even more efficient, we've leveraged Apache Airflow to automate the entire pipeline, allowing us to send automated reports to subscribers. Let's dive into the details.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide timely insights into gasoline price changes, helping consumers plan their expenses effectively by predicting whether the gasoline price will increase or decrease.

### Key Features
- Web scraping using Python to collect gasoline price data.
- Predictive analytics to forecast gasoline price fluctuations.
- Automation of the entire process with Apache Airflow.
- Automatic report generation and distribution to subscribers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python
- Apache Airflow

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gasoline-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Apache Airflow as per your requirements.

## Usage

1. Configure your web scraping sources and data collection logic in the Python script.
2. Train the predictive model using your historical gasoline price data.
3. Set up your Apache Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to automate the data retrieval, analysis, and report generation.
4. Subscribers will automatically receive reports indicating whether gasoline prices are predicted to increase or decrease.
